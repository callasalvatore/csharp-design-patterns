# C# Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of common design patterns implemented in C#.  
Each pattern is organized by category and includes a simple, focused implementation with inline explanations.

## üìÅ Structure

The patterns are grouped into the following categories:

- **Creational Patterns**  
  Deal with object creation mechanisms.
  - Singleton
    - [Basic](Creational/Singleton.Basic/README.md)
    - [Thread Safe](Creational/Singleton.ThreadSafe/README.md)
  - Factory Method
  - Abstract Factory
  - Builder
  - Prototype

- **Structural Patterns**  
  Deal with object composition and relationships.
  - Adapter
  - Bridge
  - Composite
  - Decorator
  - Facade
  - Flyweight
  - Proxy

- **Behavioral Patterns**  
  Deal with communication between objects.
  - Chain of Responsibility
  - Command
  - Interpreter
  - Iterator
  - Mediator
  - Memento
  - Observer
  - State
  - Strategy
  - Template Method
  - Visitor

Each folder contains:
- A simple C# console app demonstrating the pattern.
- A brief explanation of how it works.
- Code comments for clarity.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- Any IDE (e.g., [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/), or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## üöÄ Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CSharp-Design-Patterns.git
cd CSharp-Design-Patterns
dotnet build
```

To run a specific pattern demo:

```bash
cd Creational/Singleton
dotnet run
```

# üß† Why Design Patterns?

Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design.
They help make your code more flexible, reusable, and easier to maintain.
